This is a game, as you can see, one of the simplest games in everyday life, rock paper scissors, I put it on a web page, the game consists of three basic files, html, css, JavaScript and three images, I wrote a function containing the computer automatically selecting rock, scissors, paper.As on the requirements I saw the need to have interactivity for once and I think a game that can be played all the time is certainly very interactive
